# CDTM Backend Course

## Agenda
We want to give you an overview what is planned for the next days. We are trying to stick to the agenda, but as we are doing this course for the first time we might reschedule a little bit on the fly.

### Preparation
We designed this course for students with limited programming skills. With this in mind, we want to avoid repeating the 'Basics of Programming' lecture from the Trend Seminar. Therefore we would ask you to complete the introductory python tutorial below **before the start of the course** to get you up and running.
