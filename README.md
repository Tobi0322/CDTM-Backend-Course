## Agenda
We want to give you an overview what is planned for the next days. We are trying to stick to the agenda, but as we are doing this course for the first time we might reschedule a little bit on the fly.

### Preparation
We designed this course for students with limited programming skills. With this in mind, we want to avoid repeating the 'Basics of Programming' lecture from the Trend Seminar. Therefore we would ask you to complete the introductory python tutorial below **before the start of the course** to get you up and running.



> **TODO** 
> - [ ] Link to python tutorial

### Friday (17:00 - 21.00)
On Friday we will kick off the course with a short lecture introducing the concept of *Backend / Frontend*. After that we will setup your systems to run all the needed frameworks and libraries. And finally each of you will implement their very own web-server.

### Saturday (09:00 - 17:00)
Today we will concentrate on implementing the basic application logic of our application. In short lectures you will be introduced to the basics of *HTTP*, *REST*, *Databases* and *SQL*.
After today your server should be capable of the following things:
* Having a data modell for Todo-Items
* Handling CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Destroy) requests for Todo-Items over a RESTful API
* Storing Todo-Items persistently in a database
